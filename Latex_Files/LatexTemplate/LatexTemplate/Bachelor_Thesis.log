Class scrreprt Warning: You've used deprecated option `abstracton'.
(scrreprt)              Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrreprt)              and changes compatibility level using
(scrreprt)              `abstract=true,version=first,
(scrreprt)              enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrreprt)              in further warnings.
(scrreprt)              If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrreprt)              replace option `abstracton' by `abstract=true'.

Class scrreprt Info: Switching compatibility level to `first'.

Class scrreprt Warning: Switching back to an old KOMA-Script release does
(scrreprt)              not mean, that KOMA-Script is fully compatible with
(scrreprt)              the old release. If you need full compatibility
(scrreprt)              to an old KOMA-Script release, you should use that
(scrreprt)              old KOMA-Script release. However, in that case you
(scrreprt)              could also need old releases of other packages and
(scrreprt)              even of the LaTeX kernel.
(scrreprt)              You should also note, that the KOMA-Script developers
(scrreprt)              refuse support for documents using `version=first'.
(scrreprt)              We recommend to eliminate all deprecated options
(scrreprt)              and commands. We also recommend to not use option
(scrreprt)              `version', i.e., with other values than `last'.


Class scrreprt Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrreprt)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrreprt)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrreprt)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrreprt)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrreprt)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrreprt)              is not recommended.

Class scrreprt Info: You've used standard option `openright'.
(scrreprt)           This is correct!
(scrreprt)           Internally I'm using `open=right'.
(scrreprt)           If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,
(scrreprt)           you'd have to use `open=right' there
(scrreprt)           instead of `openright', too.

(typearea)             If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,

Package typearea Warning: You've used deprecated option `footexclude'.
(typearea)                Usage of this option indicates an old document

(typearea)                `footinclude=false,version=first,

Package typearea Warning: You've used deprecated option `BCOR10mm'.
(typearea)                Usage of this option indicates an old document

(typearea)                `BCOR=10mm,version=first,
